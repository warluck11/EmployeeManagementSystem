Collection Interface : 

1. List : 

	- elements are stored in ordered manner (maintains the insertion order)
	- elements can be accessed by using index 
	- duplicates elements are allowed
	
2. Set :

	- elements are not stored in ordered manner (does not maintain insertion order)
	- elements can not be accessed by using index 
	- duplicates elements are not allowed 
	
3. Queue : 

	- elements are not stored in ordered manner (does not maintain insertion order)
	- element can not be accessed by using index 
	- duplicates elements are allowed
	- in queue, elements are added from one side and removed from another
	
	
	4. Deque : 
		
		- extends queue interface 
		- in deque, elements can be added and removed from both the ends
	
	
	Generic And Non-Generic
	
		Generic : can have only one data type  (added in java 5)
		Non-Generic : can have more than one data type
		
		


	* Map Interface : 
	
		elements are store in key value pairs 
		
		Key : user defined index 
		
		English : 34
		Hindi : 55
		
		Key can not be duplicated but values can 
		
		
		HashMap : does not retain the insertion order 
		
		LinkdeHashMap : does retain the insertion order
		
		TreeMap : does not retain the insertion order but keys will be in sorted manner
		
		
	Differnent ways to iterator over collection 
	
	
	1. Normal For Loop : 
	
			can be only used for list as here we have index for iteration 
			
	2. Enhance For Loop :
	
			can be used for any collection but only for reading and not for 
			manipulating data 
			
	3. Iterator Interface : 
	
			can be used for any collection and can be used for both reading and 
			manipulating data 
			it can only travel in one direction 
			
			
	4. ListIterator Interface : 
	
			it extends Iterator Interface and can only be used for List
			it can travel in both directions
			
			
			
	 * Stream API : 
	 
	 		
	 		- Added in Java 8 in java.util.stream package 
	 		- to perform some operation on collection 
	 		- stream API will not store data 
	 			will take input -> perfrom operation -> send output
